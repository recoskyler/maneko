# Maneko

A MangaDex alternative to read manga from while MangaDex is under recovery. This web-app uses [MangaDex API v5.0](https://api.mangadex.org/docs.html).

## Status

Currently ~~under development while reading lots of manga and listening to [synthwave playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/163x2txK7w1r9QOIlB5LRF?si=f5bff499c75d4d0e)~~ ~~on hold~~ discontinued because MangaDex released their early access version, which was the design I was imagining ~~of other projects~~. As I'm developing this as a side-hobby-project, this might take some time. Let's hope I don't lose my motivation this time and leave this one as well.

## Designs

The designs were made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com), you can view the designs of this project [here](https://www.figma.com/file/aciJXrn4aX2jtNvxNe0X1q/MangaRex). I'm welcome to any suggestions, as I'm hopeless at UI/UX design :/ Feel free to contact me [here](mailto:recoskyler224@gmail.com).
